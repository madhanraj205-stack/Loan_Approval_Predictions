# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Title

**Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning**

## 🧩 Project Description

This project focuses on building a machine learning system that can automatically predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The prediction is based on historical loan applicant data, including personal, financial, and credit-related attributes.

In real-world banking and finance, loan approval is a critical and time-consuming process that involves checking many factors such as applicant income, employment status, credit history, loan amount, and property area. Manual evaluation of these factors can lead to delays, inconsistencies, and human errors. This project aims to simplify and automate that process using data-driven decision-making.

The system uses Python and popular data science libraries to clean and preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The trained model is then evaluated using standard performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
